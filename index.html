      <p>
        Proto is a season 1 PUBG Mobile player. He has outperformed his opponents a lot of times in the past and is known among his friends for his great sound sense and aggressiveness.
        Although Proto himself doesn't consider himself to be a pro player, his friends say otherwise. He has been repeatedly asked his secrets on "How he became this good in PUBG?". Such repeated questions gave him the idea to create a website where
        he can share his tips with his friends and create a permanent place on the internet where his thoughts and tips are stored forever. When asked about his thoughts on the site, he had this to say, " I should mention this site is just a joke and
        only represent the methods I used to get better. " Apart from gaming Proto likes to watch Web series and is currently watching the critically acclaimed 'Dark' on Netflix.

      I can assure you that this guide will perform miracles for you and you will watch
      your self turns into the player you have always wanted to be.
      In the end, I just want to say that If you are able to complete this guide and are still craving some more guidance then you can check out some YouTubers that I mention below and learn from their gameplay as well. They show some crazy
      techniques for tweaking your aim and other useful things.
      When watching these streamers I don't just want u to see it, I want you to ask this question to yourself " Why did he make this move ?" . you always
      have to see the things from their perspective and only then you will be able to achieve their level of 'Skills' and 'IQ'.
      Finally, in case you are wondering about my favorite players then they are Shroud, Jonathan, ParaBoy, and Biu Biu. Be sure to check them out.
